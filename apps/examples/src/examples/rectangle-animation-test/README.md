Test rectangle shape animations with different movement effects.

---

This example demonstrates how to animate shapes in tldraw:

1. **Create Rectangle** - Creates a red rectangle on the left side of canvas
2. **Move Left to Right** - Simple linear movement animation  
3. **Move Back and Forth** - Sequential animation: moves right then left
4. **Circular Path** - Moves along key points of a circular path
5. **Reset Position** - Stops all animations and resets rectangle to initial position

The example uses custom requestAnimationFrame-based animations to move shapes smoothly.
